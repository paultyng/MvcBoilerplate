# MvcBoilerplate

I got tired of creating this same thing everytime, and inspired by [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) decided I needed to create my blank MVC project.

## Packages

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* [MvcMiniProfiler](http://code.google.com/p/mvc-mini-profiler/)
* Modernizr
* jquery
* [HTML 5 EditorTemplates](https://github.com/paultyng/Html5MvcTemplates)
* Integrate my widescreen version of [Skeleton](https://github.com/paultyng/Skeleton) (or something similar)

## To Do

* MVC 4? (would make it so I don't need the HTML 5 templates maybe)
* What else?
